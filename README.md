# Supply-Chain-Digitalization_Trignodigi
In this digital world, the approximate rate of the grocery product is still questionable. There has been a huge difference between the retail price and manufacturing price for the grocery product especially. One among them is the fish selling. We propose a web based solution that will provide a web page that makes the visibility of the fish product between the angler, seller and the customer. Our web application TRIGNODIGI will provide the solution to connect the customer with the exact price of the particular product. This tri level methodology will be achieved through the representative from customer, angler and the seller of the city will be responsible for entering the fishery data across the places over city and which will provide the transparency of the fishery product price. Our solution will provide digitalization over the product through tri level methodology used in the application.
